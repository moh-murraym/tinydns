This module provides an interface to the DNS record format used by
the tinydns authoritative domain name server (see 
http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns.html for more information).

The module also includes a bare-bones parser for the ISC dhcpd leases file,
and a script to import hosts with dhcp leases into the tinydns data file.

The cross_platform module available at https://github.com/msaavedra/cross_platform
is required.
