tinydns
=======================

An interface to the DNS record format used by the *tinydns* authoritative
domain name server (see http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns.html for more
information on that).

The module also includes a bare-bones parser for the ISC dhcpd leases file,
and a script to import hosts with dhcp leases into the tinydns data file.

The files.py module from the  cross_platform module available at https://github.com/msaavedra/cross_platform has been copied in to reduce the number of external dependencies.

Compatible with Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.
